* Gaussian parser: Failed to parse single point calculations where the input coords are a z-matrix, and symmetry is turned off.

Changes in cclib-0.6.0
----------------------

**Feaures**

* Gaussian parser: The following bugs have been fixed Parser failed if standard orientation not found
* ccget: aooverlaps not included when using --list option

* Gaussian parser: The following bugs have been fixed
    - SCF values was not extracting the dEnergy value
    - Was extracting Depolar P instead of Raman activity

Changes in cclib-0.5
--------------------

**Features**

* (src/scripts/ccget): Added handling of multiple filenames. It's now possible to use ccget as follows: ``ccget *.log``. This is a good way of checking out whether cclib is able to parse all of the files in a given directory. Also possible is: ``ccget homos *.log``.
* Change of license: Changed license from GPL to LGPL

**Bugfixes**

* src/cclib/parser/gamessparser.py: gamessparser was dying on GAMESS VERSION = 12 DEC 2003 gopts, as it was unable to parse the scftargets.
* src/cclib/parser/gamessparser.py: Remove assertion to catch instances where scftargets is unset. This occurs in the case of failed calculations (e.g. wrong multiplicity).
* src/cclib/parser/adfparser.py: Fixed one of the errors with the Mo5Obdt2-c2v-opt.adfout example, which had to do with the SFOs being made of more than two combinations of atoms (4, because of rotation in c2v point group). At least one error is still present with atomcoords. It looks like non-coordinate integers are being parsed as well, which makes some of the atomcoords list have more than the 3 values for x,y,z.
* src/cclib/parser/adfparser.py: Hopefully fixed the last error in Mo5Obdt2-c2v-opt. Problem was that it was adding line.split()[5:], but sometimes there was more than 3 fields left, so it was changed to [5:8]. Need to check actual parsed values to make sure it is parsed correctly.
* data/Gaussian, logfiledist, src/cclib/parser/gaussianparser.py, test/regression.py: Bug fix: Mo4OSibdt2-opt.log has no atomcoords despite being a geo-opt. This was due to the fact that the parser was extracting "Input orientation" and not "Standard orientation". It's now changed to "Standard orientation" which works for all of the files in the repository.
