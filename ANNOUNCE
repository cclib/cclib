On behalf of the cclib development team, we are pleased to announce the release of cclib 1.5.3, which is now available for download from https://cclib.github.io. This is a minor update to version 1.5 that includes some new functionality and attributes, as well as bug fixes and small improvements.

cclib is an open source library, written in Python, for parsing and interpreting the results of computational chemistry packages. It currently parses output files from 13 different programs: ADF, DALTON, Firefly, GAMESS (US), GAMESS-UK, Gaussian, Jaguar, Molpro, MOPAC, NWChem, ORCA, Psi and QChem.

Among other data, cclib extracts:

    * results of SCF, post-Hartree-Fock, TD-DFT and other calculations
    * coordinates, energies and geometry optimization data
    * information about atomic and molecular orbitals
    * vibrational modes, excited states and transitions
    * charges, electrostatic moments and polarizabilities

(For a complete list see https://cclib.github.io/data.html).

cclib also provides some calculation methods for interpreting the electronic properties of molecules such as:

    * Mulliken and Lowdin population analyses
    * Overlap population analysis
    * Mayer's bond orders

(For a complete list see https://cclib.github.io/methods.html).

For information on how to use cclib, see our documentation at https://cclib.github.io.
