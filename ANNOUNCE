cclib 0.7b is now available for download from http://cclib.sf.net.

cclib is an open source library, written in Python, for parsing and interpreting the results of computational chemistry packages. It currently parses output files from ADF, GAMESS (US), GAMESS-UK, Gaussian, Jaguar and PC GAMESS.

Among other data, cclib extracts:

    * coordinates
    * atomic orbital information
    * molecular orbital information
    * information on vibrational modes
    * the results of a TD-DFT calculation 

(For a complete list see http://cclib.sf.net/wiki/index.php/Parsed_Data).

cclib also provides some calculation methods for interpreting the electronic properties of molecules using analyses such as:

    * Mulliken population analysis
    * Overlap population analysis
    * Calculation of Mayer's bond orders. 

(For a complete list see http://cclib.sf.net/wiki/index.php/Calculation_Methods).
