On behalf of the cclib development team, I am pleased to announce the release of cclib 1.2, which is now available for download from http://cclib.github.io. This beta version marks the first release to target Python 3, and includes several new features and bug fixes (see below).

cclib is an open source library, written in Python, for parsing and interpreting the results of computational chemistry packages. It currently parses output files from ADF, Firefly, GAMESS (US), GAMESS-UK, Gaussian, Jaguar, Molpro and ORCA.

Among other data, cclib extracts:

    * coordinates and energies
    * information about geometry optimization
    * atomic orbital information
    * molecular orbital information
    * information on vibrational modes
    * the results of a TD-DFT calculation 

(For a complete list see http://cclib.github.io/data.html).

cclib also provides some calculation methods for interpreting the electronic properties of molecules using analyses such as:

    * Mulliken and Lowdin population analyses
    * Overlap population analysis
    * Calculation of Mayer's bond orders. 

(For a complete list see http://cclib.github.io/methods.html).

For information on how to use cclib, see

Major changes since cclib 1.1:

    * Move project to github
    * Transition to Python 3 (Python 2.7 will still work)
    * Add a multifile mode to ccget script
    * Extract vibrational displacements for ORCA
    * Extract natural atom charges for Gaussian (Fedor Zhuravlev)
    * Updated test file versions to ADF2013.01, GAMESS-US 2012, Gaussian09, Molpro 2012 and ORCA 3.0.1
    * Many bugfixes, thanks to Scott McKechnie, Tamilmani S, Melchor Sanchez, Clyde Fare, Julien Idé and Andrew Warden
