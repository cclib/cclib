	  For a symmetrical molecule, mocoeffs were in the wrong order and
	  the homo was not identified correctly if degenerate

	  Was extracting Depolar P instead of Raman activity
	* ccopen: Minor problems fixed with identification of log files

Changes since cclib-0.5b:

Features
	* src/scripts/ccget: Added handling of multiple filenames.
	  
	  It's now possible to use ccget as follows:
	  ccget *.log
	  
	  This is a good way of checking out whether cclib is able to
	  parse all of the files in a given directory.
	  
	  Also possible is:
	  ccget homos *.log

	* Change of license: Changed license from GPL to LGPL

Bugfixes
	* src/cclib/parser/gamessparser.py: Bugfix: gamessparser was dying
	  on GAMESS VERSION = 12 DEC 2003 gopts, as it was unable to parse
	  the scftargets.
	* src/cclib/parser/gamessparser.py: Remove assertion to catch
	  instances where scftargets is unset. This occurs in the case of
	  failed calculations (e.g. wrong multiplicity).
	* src/cclib/parser/adfparser.py: Fixed one of the errors with the
	  Mo5Obdt2-c2v-opt.adfout example, which had to do with the SFOs
	  being made of more than two combinations of atoms (4, because of
	  rotation in c2v point group).
	  
	  At least one error is still present with atomcoords. It looks
	  like non-coordinate integers are being parsed as well, which
	  makes some of the atomcoords list have more than the 3 values
	  for x,y,z.
	* src/cclib/parser/adfparser.py: Hopefully fixed the last error in
	  Mo5Obdt2-c2v-opt. Problem was that it was adding
	  line.split()[5:], but sometimes there was more than 3 fields
	  left, so it was changed to [5:8]. Need to check actual parsed
	  values to make sure it is parsed correctly.
	* data/Gaussian, logfiledist, src/cclib/parser/gaussianparser.py,
	  test/regression.py: Bug fix: Mo4OSibdt2-opt.log has no
	  atomcoords despite being a geo-opt. This was due to the fact
	  that the parser was extracting "Input orientation" and not
	  "Standard orientation". It's now changed to "Standard
	  orientation" which works for all of the files in the repository.
