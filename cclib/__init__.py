"""A library for parsing and interpreting results from computational chemistry packages.

The goals of cclib are centered around the reuse of data obtained from various
computational chemistry programs and typically contained in output files. Specifically,
cclib extracts (parses) data from the output files generated by multiple programs
and provides a consistent interface to access them.

Currently supported programs:
    ADF, Firefly, GAMESS(US), GAMESS-UK, Gaussian,
    Jaguar, Molpro, MOPAC, NWChem, ORCA, Psi, Q-Chem

Another aim is to facilitate the implementation of algorithms that are not specific
to any particular computational chemistry package and to maximise interoperability
with other open source computational chemistry and cheminformatic software libraries.
To this end, cclib provides a number of bridges to help transfer data to other libraries
as well as example methods that take parsed data as input.
