# Getting Started

cclib is a Python library that provides parsers for output files of computational chemistry packages.

cclib has two interfaces a command line interface and a python interface.

## Prerequisites

- A quantum chemistry output file that you would like to parse. If you don't have one grab one from the test datafiles in the `cclib/data` folder.
- An installed version of cclib (See https://cclib.github.io/how_to_install.html)

## Your first extraction (command line interface)

### What can cclib extract from my file?

To see all of the possible attributes that cclib can extract from your output file try running the following command
```
ccget --list [filename]
```

If all goes well, cclib should be able to identify the generating code and parse attributes from the file. The command will list all of the identified attributes. For example
```
$ ccget --list dvb_sp.out
Attempting to read dvb_sp.out
cclib can parse the following attributes from dvb_sp.out:
  aonames
  aooverlaps
  atombasis
  atomcharges
  atomcoords
  atommasses
  atomnos
  charge
  coreelectrons
  gbasis
  homos
  metadata
  mocoeffs
  moenergies
  moments
  mult
  natom
  nbasis
  nmo
  scfenergies
  scftargets
  scfvalues
```

### Access some data

From the above list, accessing data is as simple as

```
$ ccget moenergies dvb_sp.out
Attempting to read dvb_sp.out
moenergies

## Your first extraction (Python interface)

### What can cclib extract from my file?

Loading an output file. The following code snippet will allow you to read in a data file.
``` python
>>> import cclib
>>> data = cclib.io.ccread("dvb_sp.out")
```

If all goes well, cclib should be able to identify the generating code and parse attributes from the file. All of the parsed attributes should be accessible in the ccData object.
``` python
>>> print(data.moenergies)
